But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The Shuttle is destroyed, leaving Stone and Kowalsky completely alone-tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness of space. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth and any chance for rescue. As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.",

Now, the company is taking its proven success and shopping it around a number of new locations, bringing Sandra to TG4 in Ireland and RSI in Switzerland. The Fairytale Detective is accompanied by her pal Fo the Elf, a 508 year old assistant who gathers Sandra’s cases, as well as Rachel, Sandra’s best pal. As if the mysteries weren’t tough enough, Markus will appear on occasion, hoping to spoil the day by bullying Sandra. Thankfully, though, Sandra always finds her way.",
